    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        These bacon wrapped cheeseburger bites, made in the air fryer, are a little bit meatloaf and a little bit cheeseburger: seasoned ground beef meatballs with Cheddar cheese centers are wrapped in bacon and fried. They are delicious and reheat well, great as an appetizer or a main. Serve with any dipping sauce you like.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            1 1/2 tablespoons Italian-seasoned breadcrumbs
        </li>
        <li>
            1/2 teaspoon onion powder
        </li>
        <li>
            1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
        </li>
        <li>
            1 teaspoon dried parsley
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine ground beef, breadcrumbs, egg, onion powder, garlic powder, parsley flakes, salt, ketchup, mustard, and dill pickle in a bowl and mix until just combined.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pinch 1 generous tablespoon of meat mixture and wrap around 1 cube of cheese. Roll to form a ball, then place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Continue with remaining meat mixture and cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cut bacon slices in half widthwise, then cut each piece in half lengthwise, making 4 strips from each bacon slice.
        </li>
        <li>
            Wrap 1 bacon strip around each meatball, securing with a toothpick or pressed tightly into the meat to stay in place. Any extra strips of bacon can be used to do a second wrap on some of the meatballs.
